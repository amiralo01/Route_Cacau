# What is Route Cocoa? ü§î

It is a web program for tracking cocoa powder in Santar√©m, showing where it comes from, where it is going or went, and demonstrates the entire industrial process it went through until it reaches its final customer. Where this end customer will be able to view this tracking either through the website itself or through the Qr Code of the product they purchased.

# What do you need to access RouteCacau? ü§î

Route Cacau is a website that will be easy to access where the user can simply search for its name (RouteCacau) on the web and find it, the user itself will directly access the menu screen where they will see the tracking screens which will show where comes their cocoa, they could also access this screen through a QR code found on the final cocoa product. Suppliers will be able to use the data entry screen, where they can add relevant information about themselves and Cacau that will be demonstrated on the tracking screen for users.

Note: It is worth mentioning that information from suppliers is received directly from them into the database.

# Commands needed to run the codes on your machine: ‚ùï 

## Node.Js

### Windows

Immediately after selecting a version (LTS or Current), the download of the installer for Windows will begin. As is common with Windows installers, just keep clicking the **Next** buttons until you reach the end of the installation.

Once the installation is complete, we will need to test that everything is ok. So, launch your terminal. Press **Windows Key + R** to open the Run program. Type **powershell** and press the **Enter** key.

</h2>

Then, in the terminal, type **node -v** and press the **Enter** key. If the Node version is displayed, your installation was successful!

</h2>

### Linux 
To run JavaScript commands you need to have Node JS already installed on your machine, but this is easy, if you use the **Linux** operating system just go to your command prompt or press Ctrl + Alt + T and it will appear, then inside it type the installation command ```curl```:
```sh
sudo apt-get install curl
```
Then run the script below to add the Node repository:
```sh
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
```
And finally, to install Node, run:
```sh
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```
Right after installation, in the terminal type node -v and press the Enter key. If the Node version is displayed, your installation was successful!

### Mac

Immediately after selecting a version (LTS or Current), the Mac installer download (.pkg file) will begin. Once you open this file, the installer will start.

</h2>

Just click to continue until it finishes installing.
We need to test if everything is ok. So, launch your terminal. To do this, press **Command + Spacebar**. Type **terminal** and press **Enter**.
Then, in the terminal, type **node -v** and press the **Enter** key. If the Node version is displayed, your installation was successful!
If you need to have more than one version of Node.js on your machine, check out this post on [how to install multiple versions of Node.js using NVM](https://www.treinaweb.com.br/blog/instalando-e-gerenciando-varias-versoes-do-node-js-com-nvm/).

## Leaflet

To be able to use the Leaflet tool, you must use the ```npm install leaflet``` command in your terminal to install the necessary dependencies on your machine. If you still have any, you can visit the [tours page](https://leafletjs.com/examples.html) of leaflet to solve them.
