# What is Route Cocoa? ðŸ¤”

It is a web program for tracking cocoa powder in SantarÃ©m, showing where it comes from, where it is going or went, and demonstrates the entire industrial process it went through until it reaches its final customer. Where this end customer will be able to view this tracking either through the website itself or through the Qr Code of the product they purchased.

# What do you need to access RouteCacau? ðŸ¤”

First you need to register in the system, after registering you need to log in and from there you will be redirected to the main page, which will show some information about the website and some options for viewing the tracking of a brand of cocoa powder. But if you already have a product with the Qr code on the tracking page, you can skip all these steps.
During the registration phase, you can also register using your Google data.

Note: It is worth mentioning that information from suppliers is received directly from them into the database.

# Tools ðŸ”§

* As it is a web system, any operating system (Windows, Ubuntu, Mac) is compatible.
* To create the code, the IDE was used. [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
* For data storage, the database was used [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
* The Location tool used to demonstrate Tracking was the [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/).
* Languages used to create the code: JavaScript, Html and CSS.

# License ðŸ“œ

This project is using the MIT license, see the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file for more details.

**Note:** Systems used in the Distributed Systems discipline as a final project, where the origin of cocoa and its process until it reaches the market are traced.
