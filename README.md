# What is Route Cocoa? ü§î

It is a web program for tracking cocoa powder in Santar√©m, showing where it comes from, where it is going or went, and demonstrates the entire industrial process it went through until it reaches its final customer. Where this end customer will be able to view this tracking either through the website itself or through the Qr Code of the product they purchased.

# What do you need to access RouteCacau? ü§î

Route Cacau is a website that will be easy to access where the user can simply search for its name (RouteCacau) on the web and find it, the user itself will directly access the menu screen where they will see the tracking screens which will show where comes their cocoa, they could also access this screen through a QR code found on the final cocoa product. Suppliers will be able to use the data entry screen, where they can add relevant information about themselves and Cacau that will be demonstrated on the tracking screen for users.

Note: It is worth mentioning that information from suppliers is received directly from them into the database.

# Commands needed to run the codes on your machine: ‚ùï 
* To be able to use the Leaflet tool, you must use the ```npm install leaflet``` command in your terminal to install the necessary dependencies on your machine.
* Para poder utilizar a base de dados MySQL voc√™ precisa realizar a sua instala√ß√£o em sua m√°quina v√° at√© o site do [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/) fa√ßa o dowload  da vers√£o compat√≠vel com sua m√°quina e instale-a, em seguida para visualizar o banco √© recomend√°vel utiliza o [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) e realizar todo o processo de configura√ß√£o dele para instal√°-lo.
* Outra op√ß√£o tamb√©m para visualizar e ativar o banco de dados mysql √© utilizar a ferramenta [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/pt_br/download.html) na qual voc√™ poder√° visualizar como administrador e sua porta local.
